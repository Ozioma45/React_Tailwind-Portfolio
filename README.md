### Theme Switcher Code Snippet

```jsx
const [theme, setTheme] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme:dark)").matches) {
    setTheme("dark");
  } else {
    setTheme("light");
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (theme === "dark") {
    document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
  } else {
    document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
  }
}, [theme]);

const handleThemeSwitch = () => {
  setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
};

return (
  <>
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={handleThemeSwitch}
      className="fixed z-10 right-2 top-2 bg-indigo-500 text-lg
      p-1 rounded-md">
      {theme === "dark" ? "ðŸŒ™" : "ðŸŒž"}
    </button>
    <div className="font-inter bg-white dark:bg-slate-900">
